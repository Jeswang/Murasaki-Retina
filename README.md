# Murasaki-Retina

[Murasaki](https://genjiapp.com/mac/murasaki/index_en.html) is a scroll-based EPUB reader I like, however it hasn't been updated since 2015 and the toolbar buttons look wired on macOS Mojave. So I redrawed all the toolbar button images in Sketch and made it looks perfect now.

## How to use the images?

Just copy all the images into Murasaki.app/Contents/Resources.
